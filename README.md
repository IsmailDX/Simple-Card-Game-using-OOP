# Simple-Card-Game-using-OOP
The game allows a player to play a card game with the computer (banker) for a total of five (5)  rounds. A player starts with $500 credit points and each round, 
the bet is fixed at $10 points. The  player wins if his hand has a value higher than the banker and he wins $10 points, otherwise he loses  the same amount to banker. 
Your game should allow for a fixed 5 rounds play where the game will end. However, a player can  choose to quit playing before the 5 rounds is up or before he starts 
a round. Before the start of a  round, the player can press ‘h’ to read the rules of the game.
